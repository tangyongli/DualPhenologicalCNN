Dual-Phenological Convolutional Networks for Paddy Rice Mapping in Cloud-Prone Regions.

leveraging composite Sentinel 2 optical imagery from both the transplanting period and the peak period of paddy rice.  To minimize the impact of missing values in the input data, we implemented a mask average pooling layer and a loss function that considers only valid observations.
